Python tutorial for SWE x ACE event!

## Welcome!
This tutorial is intended for people of any skill level. Today we're going to be learning about how we can use python to make something cool, and by extension, learning a little bit about the potential for cool fun stuff that can be made with code.

## What is Python?

According to the website:
"Python is powerful... and fast;
plays well with others; 
runs everywhere;
is friendly & easy to learn;
is Open."

Python is an interpreted high level language for general purpose programming. There are literally so many applications of Python and today we're only going to be going over the very basics of what you can do with Python and with programming as a whole.

## How to download all the stuff you'll need
If you run into any issues with the instructions below don't hesitate in either messaging me on Facebook or emailing me at dtravie@gmail.com. It can be very easy to mess things up!

* Download Python3 at the following [link.]( https://www.python.org/downloads/ ) The default settings should be fine.
If you're on Windows, verify that it worked by opening an application named `python-3.6.4`

We're going to be creating what's known as a webscraper. We're going to run a script in a language called Python which will allow us to open webpages, send information to websites, and retrieve information from websites.

To do this some other people wrote what's known as a package which is like DLC but for existing languages and codebases. The package we're going to be using today is called `webbrowser`.
